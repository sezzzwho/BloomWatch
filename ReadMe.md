# Allen Heritage Village Bloom Watch Project
## This is my pro bono data analysis using PowerBI.  The Collin County Master Gardeners Association is conducting a [phenology study](https://bit.ly/3fNTslu) of the bloom time of many perennials common to Collin County flowerbeds.  Over time, with data averages, the data collected here can help area gardeners design flowerbeds with a more concrete understanding of what blooms when in our area.
### The site of the study is located at 450 East St. Mary Drive, Allen, Texas 75002 (Across from Allen Senior Center).
